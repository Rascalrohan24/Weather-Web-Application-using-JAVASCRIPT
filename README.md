Hi Everyone!

I have created a web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).
The final web application is a functional Weather App to show weather statistics.
The application is build using the basics in JavaScript and HTML, like JavaScript Objects, functions, If statements, ... etc
The web application also uses API in JavaScript.

Our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (London, GB).

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org.
